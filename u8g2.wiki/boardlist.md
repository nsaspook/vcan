U8g2 is much more portable than U8glib. It is expected, that U8g2 will work with almost all current and upcoming boards. The following table is my personal experience with boards tested by this project. Many other boards may also work.

Basically all boards with a (more or less) up to date Arduino API will be supported by U8g2. I have feedback that the following systems work with U8g2:

* Aruino Zero, Uno, Mega, Due, 101, MKR Zero and probably all other official Arduino boards.
* Feather M0, ESP32 and 32u4
* STM32 based boards supported by the Arduino IDE
* ESP8266 and ESP32 boards supported by the Arduino IDE
* Probably all other boards, which are supported by the Arduino IDE
